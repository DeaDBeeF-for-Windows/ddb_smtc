## Downloads

You can find builds on https://github.com/DeaDBeeF-for-Windows/ddb_smtc/releases. These builds are created using GitHub Actions.

## Compile

You have to use Visual Studio (meh). I used Visual Studio 2017, and I don't know how VS compatibility works. MinGW does not support SMTC at time of writing this plugin.
